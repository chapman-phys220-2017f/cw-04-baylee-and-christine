# Instructor comments

1. Very good - much better coding style.
1. `np.vectorize` takes a function as an argument, which means just the function name.
1. Remember to finish editing your notebook to clean it up, make sure your names are on it properly, etc. It should be a professional report that you are proud of.
1. Remember to use the error messages from Travis to help you debug. Tests should help you debug, not just fail.
